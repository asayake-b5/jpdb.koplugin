* How To Use

* Ramdam of ideas/Todos:
- Support continuous mode too because I think it might not be able to work easy

- Toggle/Detoggle button (only on the drawing part?)
  - Also gesture
- Let user select how to style each type of word
- Log words in offline mode to mine later when online
- if api ever allows it, dump dictionary definition in custom definition
- accound for the word being never forget/blacklisted already
- check how the review stuff works for locked/redundant words
- if mash getnextvisiblechar not work, back to xml parsing
