* How To Use

* Ramdam of ideas/Todos:
- Support continuous mode too because I think it might not be able to work easy
  https://github.com/koreader/koreader/blob/f7d633cc3d0efd273a875132ac2de4fb4754dd02/frontend/apps/reader/modules/readerhighlight.lua#L738 good reference for going on posiition, screen size etc
- Toggle/Detoggle button (only on the drawing part?)
  - Also gesture
- Let user select how to style each type of word
- Log words in offline mode to mine later when online
- Modify the dictionary widget to include a bar above, displaying the top x/status, instead of hacking the dict title
- if api ever allows it, dump dictionary definition in custom definition
- if mash getnextvisiblechar not work, back to xml parsing
